# Installing CMake Templates

You can install CMake templates on your native Linux system.

In order to use the templates, you need to install them as
a CMake module.
On your native Linux system, use your distribution's package manager.
See the
"[Prerequisites]({% chapter_link host-configuration-doc.setup-your-build-host %})"
section for how to install packages using your distribution's package
manager.
